We can draw a conclusion from the data studies above, that vaccination inequality exists around the globe. The existence of this inequality may not be
apparent at first glance, but it does exist. Covid has hit us all relentlessly with equal intensity: it has affected everyone everywhere in the same way.
However, our fight back against it has not been uniform. The richer countries were able to fight back better because they had access to large-scale
vaccination campaigns, and thus were able to fight well with the spread of covid-19 in a much better way than the third-world countries, which still
have widespread disease. Several nations, including India, United States, Russia, United Kingdom, and many more, have extended a helping hand to
these third-world countries. Even vaccine manufacturer companies like Pfizer are taking initiatives to make vaccines available to these poor countries.
But more needs to be done. Our world is going through a challenging time when we need to be together as humans rather than diverge as countries
or ethnicities
